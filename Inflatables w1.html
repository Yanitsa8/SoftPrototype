    <p class="para">
The following photos are supported with a short explanation of the whole process of making Inflatables. 
<br>
</p>

    <!-- explanation of the beginning graphic-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img1infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Silhouette</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">On this image are shown the first steps of creating the base of the Inflatable.
<br>
The very first step is to create a graphic which then will be cut on a backing paper.  
<br>
The baking paper signifies the parts of the Inflatable in which air will go in. 
<br>
The graphic can be created on illustrator or on Silhouette, which is the program 
<br> 
for the machine as well. So if there is a very basic geometrical shape, which does 
<br> 
not need a lot of precision, it can be quicker done on Silhouette, as shown on the
<br>
photo. 
</p>
<h5 style="color: red" class="week1-para1"> YOU MUST LEAVE SPACE FOR INSERTING A TUBE IN FOR BLOWING AIR.</h5>
    <!-- backing paper, a4, sticking it-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img2infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">  

     <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Let's use some baking paper</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> When the shape, in which air should come in, is created we can proceed to 
<br>
cut that shape on backing paper sheet usng Silhouette. The size of the parchment 
<br>
paper should be maximum A4. When making the graphic for the backing paper it is 
<br>
important to not use the whole space, because when we create the graphic for the 
<br>
 vinyl (explained later) we need to put a set off with a few mm.
<br> 
Cut the backing paper in A4 and stick it to the plastic plate of Silhouette.
<br>
 Use paper tape as it is the easiest and cleanest to remove afterwards. 
<br>
Now you are ready to turn on the Silhouette!
</p>

     <!-- turn on-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img3infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">
    
    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Start the machine </h3>
        
    <p class="week1-para1"> Well, now go ahead and press the ON button on the machine! </p> 
   
     <!-- settings of the, nozzle analog and digital, put the paper in-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img4infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">
    
    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Setting that nozzle up! </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> The numbers of the nozzle are for the power that it will use. For ticker 
<br> 
material is used respectively a bigger number of the nozzle. For tinner paper, 
<br>
such as backing paper, the nozzle will do amazing job when set on 2. For the 
<br>
vinyl, I have used 5. These setting should be put also in the program of 
<br>
Silhouette manualy. When the nozzle has been manualy set on 2, and the settings
<br>
have been updated in the program than we can proceed to the following step.
<br>
Connect the machine with your laptop using the clable provided in each box 
<br>
of Silhouette. 
    </p> 
    

    <!--place paper in and start cutting-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img5infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Cutting </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> After the machine is on, the settings are put in the machine and the program, 
<br>
after Solhouette is connected with your laptop, we need to put the backing  
<br> 
paper sticked to the plastic plate in. Use the arrow to place the plate 
<br>
under the nozzle in streight line. Then press the very first button on 
<br>
the right handside. It is an illustration of the plastic plate. After 
<br> 
 the machine has taken the plate with the parchment paper simply press  
<br> 
Start in Silhouette from your PC. If you made an Ai file, you should save
<br>
 it as a specific file and send it to a PC with Silhouette on it. 
<br>
This is the only program the machine communicates with.  
    </p>
    
    
    <!--vinyl-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img6infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Vinyl </h3>
    
     <p class="week1-para1"> After the backing paper is cut we are ready to proceed to the vinyl. The vinyl,  
<br>
as already mentioned earlier is thicker than the parchment paper therefore we 
<br>
will use a nozzle power 5 put also in the program. When making the graphic 
<br>
of the vinyl we have to set at least 5 mm offset which is serving for a  
<br>
frame which will stick and keep the air inside. After the graphic is ready 
<br> 
we have to put the vynil on the plastic plate from Silhouette and stick it 
<br>
again with paper tape. Push the first button on the right handside to place 
<br>
the plate in the machine and send your document.
     </p>
    
    
    <!--remove the unessecary vinyl-->
     <img src="inflPhotos/img8infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Remove what you do no need </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> After cutting the vinyl there will be this material which you do not need.
<br>
Remove it carefully and cut the vinyl in 2 for the front and the back side 
<br>
of the Inflatable.
    </p>
    
    <!--Hot machine-->
    <img src="inflPhotos/img9infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Hot silk printing machine </h3>
    
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> After all your pieces are ready for sticking together than turn on the Hot machine. </p>
    
    
    <!--temp and backing sheets-->
     <img src="inflPhotos/img10infl.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Be careful and wait </h3>
    
     <p class="week1-para1"> Turn on the sticking machine and wait until it reaches 230 gedrees. When it is done 
<br>
put a baking paper sheet on the bottom, place your inflatable structure in  
<br>
and place a secong baking paper sheet on top of it, to prevent the vinyl  
<br>
from sticking to the Hot machine. Hold in there for around 3 minutes and  
<br> 
remove. It will be very hot in the beginning, so leave the product for  
<br>
a couple of minutes to cool down. Remove the cover of the vinyl slowly,
<br>
to not demage your structure.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Blow! </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> After all is sticked together, there is only one thing left to do.
<br>
Stick a tube in and blow. 
<br>
Enjoy your results!
