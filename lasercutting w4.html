<p style ="text-align: center"> This is documentation for preparing a vector interlocking pattern
<br>
and cutting it using the Laser Cutter. The pattern should have male and female interlocking parts.
<br>
At the end the whole pattern, or a piece of it should be included into a garment.  
</p>

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Create your Pattern using Ai or any other program for vectors</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
Using a vector program create your female and male part. I found out that geometrically correct shapes 
<br>
create great patterns, only using their original shapes. You can find many inspirations online!
<br>
So the first step is to create each of your pieces. Here I am going to show you my male and 
<br>
female parts later on, and am going to give you some small tips i find for usefull. 
<br> 
This on the photo is the vector for my female part (the part of the pattern in which 
<br>
the lock has to go) I have used circles. You can use anything else! 
</p>

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> 0,001 and bigger values</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> 
When you vector is ready you must take care to set up the stroke values. 
<br> 
0.001 pt stroke will be cut. Any bigger values will be engraved.  
<br>
On the setting for the Laser Cutter there are setting for the engraving
<br>
where you can choose the deepness.

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Male Part of the Pattern</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
This is the male part of my pattern. I have no engraving so all the strokes
<br> 
are set up with 0,001 pt value.

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">From Rhine to Laser Cutter</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> 
Because of technical issues, we were using Rhino instead of Adobe Illustrator.
<br>
When you open your .dxf file (saved from .ai to .dxf just so it can be opne in
<br>
Rhino) you pres Cntrl + P for printing and you will get the window showed on the 
<br>
photo. Then you go to Settings to turn on the Laser Cutter Settings.

    <p class="week1-para1"> 
I have two photos exaplining the setting for the two different materials I used.
<br>
The photo on the left is for the female part of the interlocking pattern.
<br>
I made the female part using a thing material and the male part using thicker one.
<br>
I thought that this would help the interlocking to be stable and it worked. 
<br>
Another way of making the interlocking stable is to make the holes in the female
<br>
part smaller than the size of the male lock. I also did this (see photos below).
<br>
On the left photo (very thin matterial) the settings are as follows:
</p>
<p style="color:red;" class="week1-para1">
    
    
                                               Speed: 100%
<br>
                                               Power: 20%
<br>
                                               Frq: 500 Hz
</p>

        
<p class="week1-para1"> 
Speed parameter : signifies the movement of the laser head.
<br>
Power parameter: output power (for thicker materials you need more power) 
<br>
Frequency parameter: laser pulses per second
<br>
On the right photo (thicker material) the settings are as follows:
</p>
        
<p style="color:red;" class="week1-para1">
        
    
                                               Speed: 90%
<br>
                                               Power: 50%
<br>
                                               Frq: 2500 Hz
<br>
    </p>
    
 <!-- cut out female part-->
  <img src="lasercuttingw4/img4PrintedFemaleInterlock.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Female Interlock </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> 
I used filtz for both patterns. The female part uses thin filtz (2mm)
<br>
The male part uses thicker filtz immitating material: polyacryl (5mm)  
<br>
(see following photo). You can see on the photo that the female part
<br> 
turned out great. There are no burned traces, which occurs when the 
<br>
settings are a bit off. A way of checking out the settings is making  
<br>
a color map. This is a must do always when you laser cut new materials!
    </p> 
    
   
   <!--color mapping-->
  <img src="lasercuttingw4/colormapping.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Color Mapping</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
    
    <h5 style="color: red" class="week1-para1">All values have to be RGB correct (ex: Red: 255, 0, 0)</h5>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> 
For making a collor map you need to create 6 sqares on Ai and give them the 7 main 
<br>
 RGB color values : red (255,0,0), green (0,255,0), blue(0,0,255), yellow (255,255,0),  
<br>
cyan(0,255,255) and magenta (255,0,255). When you are doen with the ai color map 
<br> 
 file press Cntr + P to go to the laser cutter settings. Than choose from the top 
<br>
panel Color Maping and give each color different values to check wich one is the most 
<br>
appropriate for your material. Normally we leave the speed at 100% the frequency  
<br>
at 50% and we change the power values. The colors on the color mapping should be 
<br>
the same order as the colors in the ai file.
