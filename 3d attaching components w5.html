The following photos are supported with a short explanation of the whole process of making 3d structure and printing it.

    <p class="week1-para1">
You should create your attaching components on Fusion 360, or another 3d modelling         
<br>
program. There are tutorials online on how to use these programs. 
<br>
On the photo are shown the attaching components I have created.

    <!-- the attaching part-->

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Attaching feet </h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
in order to attach the parts to each other we need a passive part         
<br>
(with holes) and an active part/s (with feet to go in the holes).
<br>
keep in mind that 3d printing is an addative process when making 
<br>
the feet and the holes. I would suggest using tolerance parameter.
<br>
The tolerance parameter can be calculated as half of the nozzle size.
<br>
You should also keep in mind that the placement of the feet should be 
<br>
mirrored to be placement of the holes, just so they can fit.
<br>
Another tip I can give is that round connections are way better
<br>
than square ones because of the sharp corners of the squares.
