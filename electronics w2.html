<h2 class="inflatables-h2" id="inflatables-h2"> Electronics 1.1</h2>

    
<p style ="text-align: center"> Using electronics is easy, interesting and pritty exciting.
<br>
Of course there are numerous professional implications of electronics, but if you know only
<br>
the basics you can create small and fun objects for presents or just for your own. 
<br>
Take a look at my documentation and give it a try at home. You don't need anything special.
<br>
What you need is a LED light, a battery, a copper tape or other transmitter. </p>



    <!-- sketch it-->
    <img src="electronics/sketch.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Sketch it</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> If you have no idea what an electricity circle is, please google it.
<br>
You should start with making a rough sketch on how you would like your circle to  
<br>
look like (paralles, series). You should not forget to write down where is the +
<br>
an where is the - of the LED. The minus of the LED should connect with the minus 
<br> 
of the battery and the same for the positive side. Once you are ready with your 
<br> 
sketch you can proceed with putting the copper tape on. It is our transimitter
<br>
of electricity between the battery and the LED. 
</p>

    <h5 style="color: red" class="week1-para1"> THE COPPER TAPE FROM THE + SIDE SHOULD NOT TOUCH WITH THE COPPER TAPE FROM THE - SIDE.</h5>
   
    
    <!-- sOLDER IT-->
  <img src="electronics/soldering.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Solder it</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> After your sketch is ready, signifying the + and - side of the LED,
<br> 
and the copper tape is already on its place, we can proceed with soldering.
<br>
All parts of attached pieces of copper tape should be soldered to prevent
<br>
any electricity disturbances. The legs of the LED should also be soldered
<br>
to the copper tape, as in this way we assure complete connection.
</p>
 
    <!-- sOLDER IT-->
  <img src="electronics/solderinglast.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Soldering space</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> Soldering is a bit scary but not complecated process. The only reason
<br> 
why I would describe it as scary is the high temperature the machine works with.
<br>
The soldering "pen" should get to 390 degrees Celsium. This temperature is 
<br>
reached in a minute, depending on how old your machine is. You have to be 
<br>
very careful during this process. The soldering "pen" is called a Soldering
<br>
Iron and the material we use to melt is called a Solder. You must keep 
<br>
always a good distance between the Solder and the Soldering Iron, because
<br>
the material melts so quickly, if your fingers are closed, you may get burned
<br>
and this is something nobody wants. So, please be very careful during this step. 
    </p>
    
    <h5 style="color: red" class="week1-para1"> PRACTISE ON SOME EXTRA MATERIAL TO GET THE SOLDERING IRON FLOW.</h5>
     
     <!-- soldering space-->
  <img src="electronics/mustodos.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Soldering space</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> It is also very important that the cable of your soldering "pen" is
<br>
untangled and free for moving. You don't want for sure any cups or things which 
<br>
can spill next to you while soldering because if you push them you might drop 
<br>
the soldering pen and then this will have rather unpleasant results.. :)
<br>
So rather BE smart than PRETEND to be smart! 
<br>
Vacuum station should always be on while soldering because of the 
<br>
evaporations from the melted material. 
    </p>
 
<h5 style="color: red" class="week1-para1"> WHEN DONE SOLDERING MAKE SURE TO TURN OF!!! THE SOLDERING IRON.</h5>
    
   <!-- almost done-->
  <img src="electronics/endresultoff.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> Ready</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> When your electicity circle is ready, and you have tested that everything
<br> runs smooth, your battery is connecting without a problem, then the best
<br>
part starts which is to decorate the electronics somehow so it looks nice.
<br>
For an example I will show you my end result. It took me a few minutes.
<br>
If you have time, you can create something cool and original!
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head"> CUTE!</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1"> Even if the decoration is a bit simple it still looks so eye catching
<br> 
because of the light. I have created a cellebration card. The electronic circle
<br>
is attached to the front side of the card and then covered with the same paper.
