You have to make your mold shape on Fusion 360 or any other 3d modeling Software. 
<br>
In the documentation of 
<a href="3d%20mold%20soft%20robotics%20w6.html"> Soft Robotics</a>
you can find a guided explanation of how to 3d print with 0.8 nozzle and the settings
<br>
that should be put in Cura. 
<br>
Enjoy!

  <p class="week1-para1">
When you are ready with your shape then save it as .stl file and open it in Cura
<br>
to set all the needed settings for the nozzle you have chosen.

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Very tiny</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
The first mold was not thought very well through. It is too tiny. 
<br> 
I had 1 mm wall thickness and also 1 mm diameter for the spikes inside.
<br>
As you can see on the photo one of them broke very easy. So there was a
<br>
need for another stronger mold. 
<br>
Also developing this concept of an innovative product I had to be very
<br>
thoughtfull of its shape and functionability. So, I made a couple of  
<br>
changes in the new mold.
     </p>
        
        
         <!-- Blue Mold-->
        
    <img src="finalProduct/pic4newmold.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Stronger Mold</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
The wall are now 3 mm thick. The spikes 2 mm (wait for it) and I added those 
<br>
cross like extensions to work as distance keepers between the jat lid and the 
<br>
Fermentation hat. The two holes on the bottom and top extension are for easier
<br>
operating with the product (puting in and taking out). So, obviously there is again something wrong here.
</p>
        
 <!-- Checking layers in cura-->
        
    <img src="finalProduct/pic5bilmoldgonewrong.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Oops!</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
Ta-daa, of course as I also extended the height of the mold the spikes got thin and long. 
<br> 
Although 2 mm they were absolutely not stable which led to them ripping of after taking
<br>
out the rubber cast. And then again I needed to create a new mold and this time make sure
<br>
that the spikes are thick! I also thought that there should be a simpler way of keeping the 
<br>
much needed distance between the hat and the jar lid, so I removed the cross extensions
<br>
And added a small whole (check next step).
<br>
I also want to mention that I am pritty new to 3d printing and working with Fusion,
<br>
so I don#t have this professional feel about it to guess from the beggining that
<br>
1 mm wall thickness is definitely to small for a rubber cast, that these 1,5 cm long
<br>
and 2 mm thick spikes will be very easy to break. So, I did lose material, which I
<br>
hope can be recycled or reused in a way. And I also learned my lesson!
</p>
        
             
   <!-- Done-->
    <img src="finalProduct/pic6newmold.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Better Mold</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
This is the new mold I xreated, 3 mm wall and spikes thickness, several bigger 
<br>
holes instead of many tiny ones. And I added the hole in the middle which purpose
<br>
you will find on the next step. This mold was great! Very stable, printed quickly,
<br>
easy to handle. 
</p>      


    <!-- rubber pouring -->
        
<img src="finalProduct/pic7exampleofanidea.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Example</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
You can see here the idea of the hole. I thought to put a whole in the middle, 
<br>
or just a shallow bed for a glass marvel ball which will work as a distance  
<br>
keeper. I loved this idea as it is very simple and 100% functional.
<br>
Another thing that was missing is a face of the product. It looked
<br>
clean and slick but it defentely needed a face! So, I decided to put 
<br>
A logo I did in the middle of the mold.
</p>
        
<img src="finalProduct/pic8logoonmold.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Add Face</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
I had a small problem with 3d printing it because it was thiner than the nozzles 
<br>
we had available. Basically, the printer just did not print it. Because of
<br>
the amount of time left, I decided to stop experimenting and start slowly 
<br>
building everything together. So, I cut the logo out of a plexiglass and 
<br>
sticked it to the last mold I had created which is the following -->
</p>

 <img src="finalProduct/craftedmold.jpg" width="500px" class="img1">   

 <p class="week1-para1">
It is important to have flexible mind ;)

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Finished Prorotype</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
So, now my mold has a pritty nice face, I also created this small "hook" on 
<br>
one side to be easy to take it out of the glass. I also created the mold 5 mm 
<br>
wider than the jar d so it can perfectly stick to the glass. It is 1 cm thick,
<br>
the holes are all way through as they are needed for air and water circulation
<br>
and the face should stay downwards. On top of it, when the time comes glass 
<br>
marvel balls can be put. I created 2 cute supplements for that reason. 
<br> 
I 3d sculpted a cabbage and an artichoke heads to function as marvels. 
</p>
        
        <img src="finalProduct/pic10supplement.jpg" width="500px" class="img1"> 

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Supplement</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
3d sculpting is definitely a process I loved trying out and I would love to 
<br>
indulge in it more. I used Fusion 360 the 'Create Form' option. It is hard, 
<br>
and can go very wrong because none of those paralels and meridians should not  
<br>
overlap, which makes the process very slow and precise, but fore me also satisfying. 
<br>
I had to print these 2 with supports which at the end I removed.

    <h3 style="color: cadetblue" class="week1-head">Gone wrong and details</h3>
    
    <p class="week1-para1">
I worked with Eco-flex 50. Although 50 is the hardest was not as hard as  
<br>
I needed it. The rubber I wanted to use is ordered but did not come on time. 
<br>
I tried also with another silicone rubber exactly for the food industry 
<br>
but it turned out not very nice. So therefore I stuck with ecoflex 50 
<br>
for the prototype. The next photo is from this gone wrong rubber.
